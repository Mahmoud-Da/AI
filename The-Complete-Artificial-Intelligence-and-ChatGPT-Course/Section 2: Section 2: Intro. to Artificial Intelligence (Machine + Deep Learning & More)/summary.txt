*** Introduction to AI (What, Why and How of Section 2)  ***
Artificial Narrow Intelligence



Artificial General:
Artificial Super Intelligence:


PS: machine learning and deep learning, which are subsets of AI,


There are three types of AI, meaning three artificial intelligence categories 
first category: (ANI)
is called artificial narrow intelligence, meaning ANI, which is also called weak AI 
is designed for relatively simple tasks
- basic voice cloning based on based technology
- self-driving cars like Tesla,
- movie recommendation engines.

this AI category is often easy to develop and implement,
but it has two limitations.

Number one, it can't learn beyond this specific task, And two, it can't adapt to new tasks.


second category: (AGI)
artificial general intelligence, meaning AGI, which is also called strong AI. The goal of AGI right here is to mimic human intelligence.
to new situations on its own. And there really isn't an example of AGI, that exists yet today,
but there's plenty of examples from movies,
science fiction movies. An example of AGI, which is strong AI,
from a movie perspective is the movie "I ROBOT" for computer think a bout it self
as well as one of my favorite video games, which is called "Detroit: Become Human".
AGI is a scientific equivalent of the splitting of the atom. And it's important to think about science fiction movies



Many people are so excited about ChatGPT
because many think that ChatGPT, is the closest thing that we have to AGI today since we can ask basically whatever we want.
but it's getting closer and closer every day we use it. and too many people think that this is the most astonishing technology
breakthrough since the internet was invented.



The advantages of AGI:
1- it can learn and adapt to wide ranges of tasks.
While ChatGPT can adapt basically to any question we ask,
so it's not really AGI yet.

2-  it can improve its performance autonomously.

but, there is challenges in developing AGI.
1- it requires significant advancements in AI technology.
2- more importantit raises ethical concerns.

so, AGI becomes a reality, more likly all companies and governments will have their own AI ethical positions
like the Department of AI and Ethics or Chief AI Ethics Officers.

and right now we're not far from this prediction at all. And currently, we have a number
of highly skilled research centers working on developing AGI.
such as OpenAI, DeepMind, and big companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Google.

And today, these companies must have external ethical researchers with them constantly.
And they have to do this in order to make sure that these companies are developing AI in the right way.

And these ethical organizations are coming from two organizations.
One of them is called MIRI, M-I-R-I, and the other one is The Future of Humanity Institute


Third category: (ASI)
is called artificial super intelligence. 

ASI features:
much smarter than any humans that we know of today. it's widely discussed among AI researchers

In terms of what the potential applications of ASI are, it would lead to unprecedented
technology advancements and innovations.

if AI were to surpass human control from an ethics, safety, and regulatory perspective.
Movies like the "Terminator" with Skynet ASI, for example, is a very extreme example of the ethical issues
that we have with ASI.
And even Warren Buffett said,
"That once we open AI's Pandora's Box,
we need to be careful because we can't go back."
And we have to make sure that future AI products don't get too much autonomy.



*** A.I. vs Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning:  ***
let's talk about the differences between AI, machine learning, and deep learning,
and see how they all fit together.
Now, since AGI, and ASI don't really exist yet, our talk will be a bout developing ANA 

ANI(artificial narrow intelligence)
refers to computer systems that perform tasks that would usually require human intelligence.
Now, machine learning is a subset of AI, that involves developing algorithms
to learn patterns from the data.
And machines learn from experience just like humans do. (when develop we use data form the excel file)
later to perform machine learning using linear regression, and other methodologies to find patterns in the data.

machine learning in more detail using an example.
if I give task to developer called Chris to write a program
to recognize this "Star War" character, Chewbacca,
how would you approach it?

how would you approach it?

- recognizing the main features of Chewbacca.
my brain says that,
"Hey, this is Chewbacca.
He has lovely hair."

"And he has a nose and eyes,
Mm-hmm. -: and a mouth as well. "

so normaly i would sit with my self And try to describe as many features as possible,
and write a code with that.

If those features exist in the image, I would say that's a Chewbacca.

so in this case any image of being that has eyes and noise and hair is a the machine learning model will say it is Chewbacca.

so here as a developer I need to supervise Chris,
meaning supervise our model, or a program by giving him
many more examples of Chewbacca, to, so he can recognize it in more details when we start writing a model.

so i have to say "Hey Chris Chewbacca has hair all over him,
as you can see this image one and this image two"

And that's where machine learning kicks in. Instead of writing all those features
as a separate program, and spending hundreds of hours, we can simply give a lot of examples to Chris,
or our machine learning model, and say, "Hey, when simple, or similar to this,
example comes your way, your job will be to say "Chewbacca."

And basically that is how we, humans and machines, learn together, through experience. (and this called supervised training)


Deep learning:
Deep learning is using artificial neural networks
to model and solve complex problems. It's inspired by humans brain structure. And deep learning is more complex.
And because of that, it requires a lot of more power.
to have this power we using the GPU next to CPU, and tell the model like use this GPU wisely to make future prediction

deep learning model, more intelligent one, meaning more  close to humans.

(doll examples for beginners)
real examples:
1- Movie Recommender systems. An AI-based model might use pre-defined rules
to suggest movies based on genre or director's preferences. Machine learning system would analyze user behavior
such as ratings and watch history to make personalized recommendations for you.
In deep learning model, system can use even better features,
and analyze movies plots for example, to provide even better and more
accurate suggestions for you.

2- text analysis:
AI text techniques might involve keyword searches and text matching. So machine learning algorithms,
remember machine learning is a subset of AI. Machine learning algorithms can analyze text data
to discover patterns or relationships, like sentiment analysis or topic modeling. And within machine learning here, we have deep learning.
deep learning can process complex language patterns to understand context, and generate advanced intelligent responses.


3- Image recognizeer:
We talked about Chewbacca example previously. And these algorithms uses features from text
such as hair, nose, eyes, and stuff like that to recognize what's actually present in that feature.
Machine learning is there to use and recognize these patterns, required to classify objects in an image
like a dog or a cat.
And deep learning systems use neural networks to analyze images at a more granular level, making them highly accurate,
in tasks like face recognition.

In summary, AI is the broadest concept, encompassing machine learning and deep learning.
Machine learning is a way of achieving AI by training models with data. And deep learning uses neural networks to solve more complex problems.
And understanding the relationship between AI, machine learning and deep learning, and their real world applications
is crucial for business leaders when evaluating AI solutions.
