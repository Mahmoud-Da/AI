*** Introduction to AI (What, Why and How of Section 2)  ***
Artificial Narrow Intelligence



Artificial General:
Artificial Super Intelligence:


PS: machine learning and deep learning, which are subsets of AI,


There are three types of AI, meaning three artificial intelligence categories 
first category: (ANI)
is called artificial narrow intelligence, meaning ANI, which is also called weak AI 
is designed for relatively simple tasks
- basic voice cloning based on based technology
- self-driving cars like Tesla,
- movie recommendation engines.

this AI category is often easy to develop and implement,
but it has two limitations.

Number one, it can't learn beyond this specific task, And two, it can't adapt to new tasks.


second category: (AGI)
artificial general intelligence, meaning AGI, which is also called strong AI. The goal of AGI right here is to mimic human intelligence.
to new situations on its own. And there really isn't an example of AGI, that exists yet today,
but there's plenty of examples from movies,
science fiction movies. An example of AGI, which is strong AI,
from a movie perspective is the movie "I ROBOT" for computer think a bout it self
as well as one of my favorite video games, which is called "Detroit: Become Human".
AGI is a scientific equivalent of the splitting of the atom. And it's important to think about science fiction movies



Many people are so excited about ChatGPT
because many think that ChatGPT, is the closest thing that we have to AGI today since we can ask basically whatever we want.
but it's getting closer and closer every day we use it. and too many people think that this is the most astonishing technology
breakthrough since the internet was invented.



The advantages of AGI:
1- it can learn and adapt to wide ranges of tasks.
While ChatGPT can adapt basically to any question we ask,
so it's not really AGI yet.

2-  it can improve its performance autonomously.

but, there is challenges in developing AGI.
1- it requires significant advancements in AI technology.
2- more importantit raises ethical concerns.

so, AGI becomes a reality, more likly all companies and governments will have their own AI ethical positions
like the Department of AI and Ethics or Chief AI Ethics Officers.

and right now we're not far from this prediction at all. And currently, we have a number
of highly skilled research centers working on developing AGI.
such as OpenAI, DeepMind, and big companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Google.

And today, these companies must have external ethical researchers with them constantly.
And they have to do this in order to make sure that these companies are developing AI in the right way.

And these ethical organizations are coming from two organizations.
One of them is called MIRI, M-I-R-I, and the other one is The Future of Humanity Institute


Third category: (ASI)
is called artificial super intelligence. 

ASI features:
much smarter than any humans that we know of today. it's widely discussed among AI researchers

In terms of what the potential applications of ASI are, it would lead to unprecedented
technology advancements and innovations.

if AI were to surpass human control from an ethics, safety, and regulatory perspective.
Movies like the "Terminator" with Skynet ASI, for example, is a very extreme example of the ethical issues
that we have with ASI.
And even Warren Buffett said,
"That once we open AI's Pandora's Box,
we need to be careful because we can't go back."
And we have to make sure that future AI products don't get too much autonomy.



*** A.I. vs Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning:  ***
let's talk about the differences between AI, machine learning, and deep learning,
and see how they all fit together.
Now, since AGI, and ASI don't really exist yet, our talk will be a bout developing ANA 

ANI(artificial narrow intelligence)
refers to computer systems that perform tasks that would usually require human intelligence.
Now, machine learning is a subset of AI, that involves developing algorithms
to learn patterns from the data.
And machines learn from experience just like humans do. (when develop we use data form the excel file)
later to perform machine learning using linear regression, and other methodologies to find patterns in the data.

machine learning in more detail using an example.
if I give task to developer called Chris to write a program
to recognize this "Star War" character, Chewbacca,
how would you approach it?

how would you approach it?

- recognizing the main features of Chewbacca.
my brain says that,
"Hey, this is Chewbacca.
He has lovely hair."

"And he has a nose and eyes,
Mm-hmm. -: and a mouth as well. "

so normaly i would sit with my self And try to describe as many features as possible,
and write a code with that.

If those features exist in the image, I would say that's a Chewbacca.

so in this case any image of being that has eyes and noise and hair is a the machine learning model will say it is Chewbacca.

so here as a developer I need to supervise Chris,
meaning supervise our model, or a program by giving him
many more examples of Chewbacca, to, so he can recognize it in more details when we start writing a model.

so i have to say "Hey Chris Chewbacca has hair all over him,
as you can see this image one and this image two"

And that's where machine learning kicks in. Instead of writing all those features
as a separate program, and spending hundreds of hours, we can simply give a lot of examples to Chris,
or our machine learning model, and say, "Hey, when simple, or similar to this,
example comes your way, your job will be to say "Chewbacca."

And basically that is how we, humans and machines, learn together, through experience. (and this called supervised training)


Deep learning:
Deep learning is using artificial neural networks
to model and solve complex problems. It's inspired by humans brain structure. And deep learning is more complex.
And because of that, it requires a lot of more power.
to have this power we using the GPU next to CPU, and tell the model like use this GPU wisely to make future prediction

deep learning model, more intelligent one, meaning more  close to humans.

(doll examples for beginners)
real examples:
1- Movie Recommender systems. An AI-based model might use pre-defined rules
to suggest movies based on genre or director's preferences. Machine learning system would analyze user behavior
such as ratings and watch history to make personalized recommendations for you.
In deep learning model, system can use even better features,
and analyze movies plots for example, to provide even better and more
accurate suggestions for you.

2- text analysis:
AI text techniques might involve keyword searches and text matching. So machine learning algorithms,
remember machine learning is a subset of AI. Machine learning algorithms can analyze text data
to discover patterns or relationships, like sentiment analysis or topic modeling. And within machine learning here, we have deep learning.
deep learning can process complex language patterns to understand context, and generate advanced intelligent responses.


3- Image recognizeer:
We talked about Chewbacca example previously. And these algorithms uses features from text
such as hair, nose, eyes, and stuff like that to recognize what's actually present in that feature.
Machine learning is there to use and recognize these patterns, required to classify objects in an image
like a dog or a cat.
And deep learning systems use neural networks to analyze images at a more granular level, making them highly accurate,
in tasks like face recognition.

In summary, AI is the broadest concept, encompassing machine learning and deep learning.
Machine learning is a way of achieving AI by training models with data. And deep learning uses neural networks to solve more complex problems.
And understanding the relationship between AI, machine learning and deep learning, and their real world applications
is crucial for business leaders when evaluating AI solutions.




*** 5. [A/B] Exercise on Machine Learning & Netflix ***

machine learning is a way to achieve AI by training models to learn from data.

simple machine learning case study:
Netflix uses machine learning to help over a hundred million of its customers
to achieve superior bandwidth usage.

it do that by:
which regions watch content at certain times.

For example, years ago,
Netflix released a season of "House of Cards," and over 50% of its internet usage in Washington DC
on a particular day was used to watch this show. By using machine learning,
Netflix can improve bandwidth by using caching and other technologies.
Now, if the website or webpage for your company experiences a massive amount of users at a particular time,
then you can use machine learning to anticipate when this might occur

on other word "Using Machine Learning to understand website Traffic data"

if the website or webpage for your company experiences a massive amount of users at a particular time,
then you can use machine learning to anticipate when this might occur and in which regions of the world
in order to make sure that you achieve optimal sales and a better customer experience.

It might be when your company releases a new product or online service in a particular region.
Then what you can do is you can analyze the data using machine learning
in order to consider using caching technologies from content delivery networking companies
like CloudFlare, Google Cloud CDN, or Amazon CloudFront,
and the links to those three CDN
or Content Delivery Network products and companies

how that works:
as example we have media company we will to analyze web traffic for this a pretend media company,
and then let's analyze the data usage by using machine learning in order to understand
when too much traffic hits our website.
So we can consider using some content delivery networks to speed up the traffic at certain times.

we will use "web_traffic_anomalies.csv" it`s a simple traffic data for a a pretend media company.
it have two columns one for data_hour and other for the number of web traffic at that hour.


However, we noticed that some hours are extreme low traffic
while some others are extremely high traffic, where our webpage won't load fast enough.
We call these hours anomalies or outliers. Let's use machine learning
to try to detect these anomalies in upcoming months.

now using this AI MODEL https://ai-course-for-executives.streamlit.app/
select AL/ML Exercise and upload the csv file 

after upload the file we can see the result of the anomalies of the next month
You have some in the reds, which are actually anomalies
and that are considered outliers, something that we didn't anticipate, for example,
for the future.


*** 6. [A] Supervised & Unsupervised Machine Learning + Reinforcement Learning ***
When we work in a company and we are analyzing data,
our boss supervises us and tells us to use certain columns of data
that have labels, like the date in one column and sales in another column of data. And when we're babies,
we don't have structure because we crawl around and we analyze everything without supervision.
And as babies, we aren't taught what columns of data are with labels.

we're gonna focus on three main categories:
1- supervised learning, (example: toy story character)
is recognize "Andy" from the examples.

we provide computer with inputs, or the data, and the computer uses machine learning
to tell us the output.

in between with the input x, which is our data, for example, and in order to solve for y,
which is the target. or something that we are trying to predict.




Let's assume that we are going to use supervised machine learning in Excel
to come up with an equation that can connect our data to predict the price of these nesting dolls.

So to sum up, we have some information, about these nesting dolls,
and based on that information, we are going to try to predict the price of them
in the future.
like you did in the previous lecture we have to tell the developer what to do with the data in our pdf file.

- first as ML enginers we check the features of the data so we can categorize the data with labels
in the column three, which is the prices, including column one, which is the name of the nesting doll.
Now, in the column two, we have its height, and in the column three, we have price,
which we are trying to predict.

so first after our program read the csv file. So what it`s gonna do is gonna analyze this data in our excel file.
And it will create an equation to see what the price per nesting doll should be
based on the height. 

in more detail fisrt:
it gonna do a linear regression analysis. 
Meaning, it gonna look at all the data,
and find patterns, And the patterns can be represented with a line
that goes through our data and shows how our data may change.

Then Excel will create a formula for us.

in excel we go to Data in select "Data Analysis" and select "Regression" 
then we set Y to the prices we have and X for height in inches

and this is gonna create a formula for us to tell us what should it be 
then we click on lebals check box cause we have labels 

and set output range we and select the "Line Fit Plate" check box 

after we press ok we will have we go to "Chart Design" => and press "Add Chart Element" => "Trendline"  =>  "Linear"
then to show the formula we go to "Quick Layout" and show the formula

PS: formula accuraicy can show the power of the model for certain data 

now we got 
y = 1.0607x + 0.6585

Neural Mathematics
y = wx + b

y = target
x = input
w = weights
b = bias


y = (class) classification counts or output and can be integer or float 

we have y and x (matrix with too much pixel when model training data it try to  change w and b to give the best value to Y )


when images x = is pixel 
　2
 R = 1


x which is height.

now we use our formula to callculate what the price when the toy height is 4

to test it we take 1.0607x + 0.6585 in excel and in some empty column we write it "=1.0607*4 + 0.6585"
and this how it works in simple way 

in our case it was price based in the height and it So it makes sense because if less material, well, it cost less 

in summary

1-  supervised learning is a type in ML where we have the data and we already know what we want to achieve
with machine learning.

2- a classification part when we used a multi images of "Audi" and feed to our model to let us know when it see a new picture 
if it "Audi" or not



classification is when we have specific class or a group that we want to say
is it in this group or not.
And on the other hand, we have the regression where we would like to estimate
or to continue some trend, in this case, for example, price
other regression examples,
such as demand forecasting, price optimization, stock market prediction,product recommendation
and anything else that we would like to predict or, for example, the seller in a company as well. And many, many others,


Supervised learning takes everything from what we can do based on the data and tries
to map to some output that you already know and you would like to continue predicting that outcome
in the future based on the data that you already have.

Companies wanting to apply machine learning and AI in this process, they always start with a question.
"Can we structure the problem as a supervised problem?"
Because of this, most machine learning projects in the world at this time can be classified
as a supervised learning task. It's the easiest one and most predictable one to do so.

2- Category two out of three for types of machine learning
is called unsupervised learning.

Unsupervised learning algorithms work with unlabeled data,

aiming to discover underlying patterns or groups, meaning clusters, within the data.
And this type of learning can be useful for businesses in tasks like customer segmentation.
Meaning, are these types of customers more likely to buy a certain type of product or not?
Another example is "anomaly detection" in financial transactions, like fraud.
Or the Securities and Exchange Commission analyzing data


3- The category three out of three is called reinforcement learning.
learns to make decisions by interacting with the environment.
And here, we are giving the reward or penalties based on the goals that we define.
So the goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative reward over time.


Finally, keep in mind that machine learning models
might require regular updates and maintenance as new data becomes available
or the business context changes.
For example, YouTube and Google and Meta
often change their algorithms, and any machine learning process based on algorithms
that change might also need to be updated.
