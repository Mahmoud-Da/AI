- Authentication:
The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. 
You can create API keys at a user or service account level.
Service accounts are tied to a "bot" individual and should be used to provision access for production systems.
Each API key can be scoped to one of the following,

Project keys - Provides access to a single project (preferred option); access Project API keys by selecting the specific project you wish to generate keys against.
User keys - Our legacy keys. Provides access to all organizations and all projects that user has been added to; access API Keys to view your available keys.
We highly advise transitioning to project keys for best security practices, although access via this method is currently still supported.
