# Lecture Notes: The Rise of the AI Engineer

## 1. Introduction

Since the release of ChatGPT, the software industry has been evolving rapidly. New models, tools, APIs, expectations, and job roles are emerging at a fast pace. One of the most notable new roles is the **AI Engineer**.

## 2. AI Engineer vs. Machine Learning Engineer

### Machine Learning Engineer

* Focuses on building and training models.
* Works with data cleaning, model architectures, and tuning.
* Involves heavy math, research, and optimization of training pipelines.

### AI Engineer

* Focuses on using **pre-trained models**, especially large language models (LLMs).
* Does not need deep mathematical or theoretical understanding of model internals.
* Needs strong skills in integrating models into real-world applications.
* Similar to how software engineers use databases without knowing internal implementation details.
* Main goal: apply existing AI capabilities to solve practical problems.

## 3. What AI Engineers Build

Companies today are increasingly hiring engineers who can integrate AI-powered features into their products. Examples include:

* Summarization
* Translation
* Intelligent search
* Automation tools
* Personalized user experiences

## 4. Real-World Examples

### 1. Amazon Product Review Summaries

* AI-generated summaries help customers understand reviews quickly.
* Speeds up decision-making and increases conversions.

### 2. ActiveCampaign

* Allows marketers to generate full email campaigns from prompts.
* Eliminates the need to start from a blank page.

### 3. Translation on Social Platforms (e.g., X/Twitter)

* LLMs detect language, identify the user’s locale, and generate translations instantly.
* Now a standard feature across social and news platforms.

### 4. Content Moderation on YouTube and Twitch

* AI automatically flags spam, hate speech, and inappropriate content.
* Reduces the need for large teams of human moderators.

### 5. Freshdesk Ticket Routing

* AI categorizes, prioritizes, and routes user support tickets.
* Helps agents spend more time solving issues instead of sorting them.

### 6. Redfin Real Estate Assistant

* Built-in chat assistant answers property-specific questions instantly.
* Reduces friction and removes the need to wait for human agents.

## 5. Why AI Engineering Matters

* AI features are becoming standard, not optional.
* They save time, cut costs, and improve user experience.
* The demand for developers who can work with LLMs is increasing quickly.
* In the future, AI tooling knowledge will be as essential as database skills are today.

## 6. Core Skills for AI Engineers

* Understanding of large language models (LLMs)
* Prompt engineering
* Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
* Vector databases
* Building AI agents
* Integrating AI with real-world applications

## 7. Course Direction

This course introduces the foundations needed to work effectively with modern AI systems.
The next lesson will explain what a large language model is in simple, practical terms.
