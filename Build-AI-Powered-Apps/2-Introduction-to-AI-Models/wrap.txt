# Lecture Notes: The Rise of the AI Engineer

## 1. Introduction

Since the release of ChatGPT, the software industry has been evolving rapidly. New models, tools, APIs, expectations, and job roles are emerging at a fast pace. One of the most notable new roles is the **AI Engineer**.

## 2. AI Engineer vs. Machine Learning Engineer

### Machine Learning Engineer

* Focuses on building and training models.
* Works with data cleaning, model architectures, and tuning.
* Involves heavy math, research, and optimization of training pipelines.

### AI Engineer

* Focuses on using **pre-trained models**, especially large language models (LLMs).
* Does not need deep mathematical or theoretical understanding of model internals.
* Needs strong skills in integrating models into real-world applications.
* Similar to how software engineers use databases without knowing internal implementation details.
* Main goal: apply existing AI capabilities to solve practical problems.

## 3. What AI Engineers Build

Companies today are increasingly hiring engineers who can integrate AI-powered features into their products. Examples include:

* Summarization
* Translation
* Intelligent search
* Automation tools
* Personalized user experiences

## 4. Real-World Examples

### 1. Amazon Product Review Summaries

* AI-generated summaries help customers understand reviews quickly.
* Speeds up decision-making and increases conversions.

### 2. ActiveCampaign

* Allows marketers to generate full email campaigns from prompts.
* Eliminates the need to start from a blank page.

### 3. Translation on Social Platforms (e.g., X/Twitter)

* LLMs detect language, identify the user’s locale, and generate translations instantly.
* Now a standard feature across social and news platforms.

### 4. Content Moderation on YouTube and Twitch

* AI automatically flags spam, hate speech, and inappropriate content.
* Reduces the need for large teams of human moderators.

### 5. Freshdesk Ticket Routing

* AI categorizes, prioritizes, and routes user support tickets.
* Helps agents spend more time solving issues instead of sorting them.

### 6. Redfin Real Estate Assistant

* Built-in chat assistant answers property-specific questions instantly.
* Reduces friction and removes the need to wait for human agents.

## 5. Why AI Engineering Matters

* AI features are becoming standard, not optional.
* They save time, cut costs, and improve user experience.
* The demand for developers who can work with LLMs is increasing quickly.
* In the future, AI tooling knowledge will be as essential as database skills are today.

## 6. Core Skills for AI Engineers

* Understanding of large language models (LLMs)
* Prompt engineering
* Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
* Vector databases
* Building AI agents
* Integrating AI with real-world applications

## 7. Course Direction

This course introduces the foundations needed to work effectively with modern AI systems.
The next lesson will explain what a large language model is in simple, practical terms.

# Lecture Notes: What Is a Large Language Model (LLM)

## 1. Introduction

Now that the importance of AI is clear, this lesson explains a core concept: the **large language model**.

## 2. What Is a Language Model

* A language model is a system trained to understand and generate human language.
* It can process text, detect patterns, and generate coherent output.

## 3. Examples of Language Models

### Commercial Models

* GPT by OpenAI
* Gemini by Google
* Claude by Anthropic
* Grok by xAI

### Open Source Models

* Llama by Meta
* Mistral by Mistral AI
* Many others available publicly.

## 4. Why They Are Called “Large”

* Trained on massive datasets: books, articles, forums, code, documentation, and more.
* Contain billions of parameters.
* These parameters encode patterns in grammar, structure, tone, and factual associations.

## 5. How LLMs Work Conceptually

* When you prompt an LLM with a sentence like “The capital of France is”, it does not search for the answer.
* It predicts the most likely next words based on patterns learned during training.
* This is similar to autocomplete, but far more powerful.

## 6. Nature of an LLM

* A large language model is essentially a huge mathematical structure.
* The model does not understand language the way humans do.
* It does not possess beliefs or intelligence.
* It generates outputs based on probability, not truth.

### Why Answers Vary

* Asking the same question multiple times produces different responses.
* This happens because the model generates new text each time rather than retrieving stored answers.

## 7. The Importance of Training Data

* Training data determines the model’s behavior.
* If the data is biased, low quality, or inaccurate, the model’s output will reflect that.
* This explains:

  * Political bias in some models
  * Confident but incorrect answers
  * Inconsistent reasoning

## 8. Models Generating Code

* LLMs are trained on billions of lines of code from public repositories.
* Much of this code is outdated, poorly designed, or incorrect.
* The model cannot distinguish good code from bad code.
* As a result:

  * Generated code may look correct
  * It may compile
  * But it can still be insecure, buggy, or full of anti-patterns
* Blind trust in model-generated code is risky.

## 9. Garbage In, Garbage Out

* A model’s quality mirrors the quality of its training data.
* Clean, accurate data produces reliable models.
* Messy or biased data produces unreliable results.

## 10. Training Costs and Constraints

* Training large models requires:

  * Massive datasets
  * Thousands of GPUs
  * Weeks or months of computation
  * Extremely expensive infrastructure
* Only a small number of companies can afford to train such models from scratch.

## 11. Role of Developers vs. ML Engineers

* Developers typically do not train models.
* Instead, developers:

  * Use pre-trained models
  * Write effective prompts
  * Understand model limitations
  * Integrate models into applications
* This is similar to using a database without building one yourself.

## 12. Course Direction

The upcoming lessons will cover important foundational concepts such as:

* Tokens
* Cost
* How to choose the right model for a task

# Lecture Notes: How Developers Integrate LLMs into Applications

## 1. Position of LLMs in Application Architecture

Modern applications typically include:

* A frontend (often built with React or similar).
* A backend server.
* A database for storing application data.
* A language model (LLM) used to generate or process content.

The LLM is not the core of the application. It acts as a supporting system.

* We send the model input (a prompt).
* We receive a response.
* The application uses that response to improve or automate user experiences.

## 2. Common Use Cases for LLM Integration

### 1. Summarization

* Used to create concise summaries of long text.
* Example: Amazon summarizes product reviews on product pages.
* Now a standard feature in many modern applications.

### 2. Content Generation

* Generating emails, product descriptions, advertisements, and social media posts.
* Saves time and removes the need to create content from scratch.

### 3. Text Classification

* Categorizing user input automatically.
* Example questions models can answer:

  * Is this message spam or not?
  * Is this review positive or negative?
  * What category does this support ticket belong to (billing, login, cancellation)?

LLMs can output structured data such as JSON, allowing the backend to:

* Parse the result
* Store it
* Make automated decisions

### 4. Translation

* Converting text from one language to another.
* Used in platforms like X/Twitter.
* Built into modern systems such as iOS for real-time translation.

### 5. Information Extraction

* Pulling structured data from unstructured sources.
* Example: Extracting invoice details (invoice number, amount, names, addresses) from messy text or PDFs.

### 6. Chatbots

* Creating conversational assistants.
* Can answer questions using:

  * User-specific data
  * Business documents
  * Knowledge bases
* Often integrated directly into websites or applications.

## 3. A Common Pattern: Text In → Text Out

All of these use cases follow a consistent workflow:

1. The application sends a prompt or text input.
2. The LLM returns text or structured output.

The output can be:

* Plain text
* Arrays
* JSON objects
* Numbers
* Images
* Or any form of content that the application can use

## 4. Next Steps

Now that the use cases are clear, the next lesson will explore what is actually inside a large language model and how it works internally.
