Build AI-Powered Apps
Section Recap: Introduction to AI Models
• AI engineering is becoming a critical skill for modern developers, with real
applications across industries.
• We explored how large language models (LLMs) are used in apps for
summarization, content generation, translation, classification, and more.
• A large language model is a type of AI system trained on massive amounts of text
to predict the next word in a sentence.
• LLMs are made up of billions of parameters that encode statistical patterns in
human language.
• These models don’t “understand” like humans do — they generate responses
based on probabilities and training data.
• Tokens are the basic units of input/output in LLMs, representing chunks of text such
as words or punctuation.
• The number of tokens used in a request directly impacts both cost and model limits.
• Every LLM has a context window, which defines how many tokens it can handle at
once.
• We learned how to count tokens programmatically using a tokenizer, to help us
estimate cost and stay within model limits.
• Choosing the right model depends on factors like reasoning ability, speed, cost,
context window size, and support for different modalities.
• Some models are better suited for lightweight tasks, while others are designed for
more complex reasoning.
• We explored how model settings like temperature, max tokens, and top_p affect the
style, length, and variability of responses.
• Understanding these concepts helps us use LLMs more effectively and build more
reliable AI-powered applications.
