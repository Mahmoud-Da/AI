# Lecture Notes: Building AI-Powered Applications

## 1. Introduction

AI is increasingly integrated into modern applications, yet many developers have not actually built AI-powered features.
This course teaches how to create real, practical AI features similar to those used by major companies such as Google and Amazon.

## 2. Foundations of AI Development

Before building projects, the course covers the core concepts every developer must understand:

* How language models work
* Tokens and context windows
* Selecting the appropriate model for a task
* Model settings and configuration
* Fundamentals of prompt engineering

## 3. Hands-On Projects

### Project 1: Theme Park Chatbot

You will build a chatbot for an imaginary theme park.
It will answer visitor questions and help them find information quickly.

### Project 2: Customer Feedback Analyzer

You will create a tool that processes customer feedback and produces:

* Clear insights
* Actionable recommendations
  This enables users to make faster and more informed decisions.

### Project 3: Open-Source Integrations

You will explore open-source AI tools that can run in any environment.
This includes integrating them into real applications.

## 4. Development Practices and Tools

Throughout the course, you will learn:

* Clean architecture principles
* Industry best practices
* Modern development tools, including:

  * Bun
  * Tailwind
  * Shadcn
  * Prisma
  * Ollama

## 5. Instructor Background

The course is taught by Mosh Hamedani, a software engineer with over 20 years of experience.
He has taught millions of students through YouTube and his platform CodeWithMosh.com.

## 6. Getting Started

Learners are encouraged to subscribe to the channel for ongoing content.
The lecture concludes with an invitation to begin the course.

# Lecture Notes: Course Prerequisites & What You’ll Need

## 1. Who this course is for

Ideal student: a frontend developer who wants to add AI features to real apps. Basic frontend knowledge is expected; deep expertise is not required.

## 2. Required knowledge (must-have)

* **Modern JavaScript / TypeScript**: familiarity with ES6+ syntax (arrow functions, destructuring).
* **Asynchronous JS**: promises, `async` / `await`, basic error handling.
* **React basics**: creating components, JSX, `useState`, `useEffect`. You don’t need to be an expert—just comfortable building simple React apps.

## 3. Helpful but optional knowledge (nice-to-have)

* **Backend fundamentals**: REST APIs, routing, authentication.
* **Databases**: basic CRUD operations and schema thinking.
* **TypeScript types**: interfaces/types for props and API responses.
* **Basic ML/AI concepts**: high-level understanding of models, prompts, and inference (not required; covered in course).

## 4. Development environment & tools (recommended)

* **Node.js / Bun** for local development and build tools.
* **Package manager** (npm, pnpm, or Bun).
* **React toolchain**: Vite, Create React App, or Bun + a compatible bundler.
* **Database / ORM (optional)**: SQLite/Postgres and Prisma for examples that persist data.
* **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI styling (optional but used in examples).
* **Code editor**: VS Code or similar with TypeScript support.
* **API keys**: accounts and keys for any cloud AI services you plan to follow along with (if using cloud examples).

## 5. Practical expectations & outcomes

* You will learn incrementally: foundations first, then build three hands-on projects (chatbot, feedback analyzer, open-source integrations).
* The instructor will cover any AI-specific basics you need—no prior AI experience required.
* By course end you’ll be able to design and ship AI features integrated into frontend apps.

## 6. Quick starter checklist

* [ ] Install Node.js (or Bun) and a package manager.
* [ ] Set up a React project (Vite recommended).
* [ ] Ensure TypeScript is enabled or ready to add.
* [ ] Familiarize yourself with `async/await` through a small API call exercise.
* [ ] Optional: create free accounts for any AI provider you might want to try.

## 7. Suggested preparatory exercises (30–90 minutes total)

1. Build a small React component that fetches data from a public API using `async/await`.
2. Create a TypeScript interface for the API response and use it in the component.
3. Add a simple Tailwind layout to practice tailwind utility classes.

## 8. Next steps before the first lecture

1. Confirm your dev environment is working (project builds, dev server runs).
2. If you want to follow cloud-based examples, sign up for any AI provider and obtain an API key.
3. Bring a small project idea you’d like to add an AI feature to—this will help apply course projects to something real.

*** 3- What You'll Learn ***

# Lecture Notes: Course Structure and What to Expect

## 1. What This Course Is Not

This is not a quick one-hour “build an AI startup instantly” type of course.
You will not simply paste prompts into a tool and hope for magic.
The goal is to build practical, meaningful AI features that improve real applications.
Everything will be done properly, with a clear understanding of what happens under the hood.

## 2. Course Philosophy

* No shortcut-driven “vibe coding.”
* Focus on building smart, useful, and maintainable AI-powered features.
* Emphasis on clarity, architecture, and deep understanding.
* Hands-on approach: you are expected to code along.

---

# 3. Course Structure

## Section 1: Foundations

You will learn the essential concepts behind modern AI systems:

* What language models are and what they can do
* Tokens and context windows
* Model parameters such as temperature
* How to call and interact with models
  This section prepares you with the core knowledge needed for later projects.

---

## Section 2: Full-Stack Project Setup

You will build a modern full-stack environment from scratch.

### Why not Next.js?

The instructor chose not to use Next.js because:

* Not everyone uses or likes it
* Some developers prefer a fully separated frontend and backend
  Keeping them separate makes it easier to understand how they communicate

### Tools used in this section:

* Bun
* Express
* React
* Tailwind
* Shadcn

Even if you have never used these tools, everything is taught from the ground up.

### If you prefer Next.js

All concepts in this course apply equally well to Next.js.
Only the folder structure is different; the principles stay the same.

---

## Section 3: Project 1 — Theme Park Chatbot

A full-stack chatbot that answers questions about an imaginary theme park.

### Backend

* Built step by step
* Refactored using clean architecture principles
* Focus on clarity, structure, and maintainability

### Frontend

* Built progressively
* UI improvements and feature additions
* You will code along in every step

### Learning approach

Watch each lesson once, take notes, then code along.
Lessons are short and focused to help you absorb information easily.

---

## Section 4: Prompt Engineering

You will learn how to write prompts effectively by:

* Giving proper context
* Controlling output format
* Using examples
* Handling errors
* Reducing hallucinations
  This section improves your ability to work with models at a high level.

---

## Section 5: Project 2 — Product Review Summarizer

A more advanced full-stack project.

### Features and learning focus

* Summarize product reviews like many modern e-commerce sites
* Build the entire system from scratch
* Use a database with Prisma and migrations
* Explore more complex patterns and best practices
* Techniques learned here can be reused for many other AI features
  This project is larger and more realistic than the chatbot, allowing deeper learning.

---

## Section 6: Open-Source Models

You will learn:

* Why open-source models matter
* How to discover suitable models
* How to run them locally
* How to integrate them into the applications you build
  This gives you independence from commercial APIs and expands your AI toolbox.

---

## 7. How to Get the Most Out of the Course

* Watch lessons in order
* Code along with every project
* Pay attention to tips, tricks, and shortcuts
* Stay active and engaged from the beginning
  This is a hands-on course, not a passive watch-and-forget series.

---
