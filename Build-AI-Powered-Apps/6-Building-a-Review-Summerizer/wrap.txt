## Lecture Overview: Product Review Summarizer Project

### 1. Project Introduction

* This section introduces a more advanced and engaging project.
* The goal is to build a **product review summarizer**.
* Users can generate a concise summary instead of reading all individual reviews.

### 2. User Experience Flow

* A product page displays:

  * A list of user reviews for a product.
  * A button to summarize the reviews.
* When the user clicks the **Summarize Reviews** button:

  * A summary is generated automatically.
  * The summary helps users quickly understand overall feedback.

### 3. Summary Persistence

* Once the summary is generated:

  * It is stored in the database.
  * When the user revisits the page, the summary is retrieved from the database.
  * The summary does **not** need to be regenerated each time.
* This improves:

  * Performance
  * Cost efficiency
  * User experience

### 4. Common Industry Pattern

* This “generate once, reuse later” pattern is increasingly common in modern applications.
* Especially relevant for:

  * AI-powered features
  * Content summarization
  * Recommendation systems

### 5. Project Complexity

* This project is more complex than the previous chatbot project.
* It is a **full-stack application**, involving:

  * Frontend (user interface)
  * Backend (business logic)
  * Database (data storage)

### 6. Database Introduction

* The project uses a database to store summaries.
* Prior database knowledge is **not required**.
* The instructor will cover:

  * Essential database concepts
  * Only what is necessary for this project

### 7. Learning Mindset

* The project is meant to be built step by step.
* Learners are encouraged to:

  * Take their time
  * Follow along carefully
  * Treat this as a hands-on learning experience

## Lecture Overview: Database Setup for the Project

### 1. Project Complexity

* This project is more complex than the previously built chatbot project.
* It is a **full-stack application**.
* The application includes its **own database**, which is a core component of the system.

### 2. Purpose of This Segment

* The focus of this segment is on **setting up the database from scratch**.
* The database will serve as the foundation for the rest of the application.

### 3. Database Initialization

* The database will be:

  * Created from the ground up
  * Properly structured to support application features

### 4. Populating the Database

* The database will be filled with **realistic sample data**.
* This ensures:

  * Meaningful testing
  * More realistic development scenarios
  * Better understanding of how the application behaves with real data

### 5. Role of the Database in Development

* Having realistic data allows developers to:

  * Build features more effectively
  * Test logic and edge cases
  * Develop and debug the application with confidence

### 6. Next Steps

* With the database in place and populated:

  * The rest of the application can be built on top of it
  * Backend and frontend features can be developed incrementally

*** 2.1- Setting Up MySQL ***
---

## Lecture Overview: Database Setup with MySQL

### 1. Purpose of This Step

* Before building the API, a database must be set up.
* The database will store:

  * Products
  * Reviews
  * Generated summaries
* This database is a foundational part of the application.

### 2. Database Technology Choice

* The project uses **MySQL**.
* MySQL is:

  * Open source
  * A relational database system
  * Widely used in real-world production applications

### 3. Installation Options

* If MySQL is already installed locally:

  * You can continue using the existing installation.
* If MySQL is not installed:

  * Download and install it from the official website.

### 4. Downloading MySQL

* Open a browser and go to **mysql.com**.
* Navigate to the **Downloads** section.
* Scroll to the bottom and select **MySQL Community Downloads**.
* Click on **MySQL Community Server**.
* Choose the latest version for your operating system.

#### Mac-Specific Notes

* Select the correct package based on CPU architecture:

  * ARM (Apple Silicon)
  * x86 (Intel CPUs)
* On the download page:

  * No login or signup is required.
  * Click **“No thanks, just start my download”**.

### 5. Installing MySQL

* Open the installer once the download completes.
* Follow the installation steps:

  * Click **Continue**
  * Agree to the license terms
  * Proceed with installation
* When prompted:

  * Enter your computer’s login password.
* Set a password for the **root (admin) MySQL user**.

  * This password is important and will be used later in the application.
  * Make sure to remember it.
* Complete the installation.
* Enter your computer password again if requested.
* After installation, the installer file can be moved to trash.

### 6. Verifying the Installation

* Open a terminal window.
* Run the following command:
-------------------code----------------------
mysql -u root -p
-------------------code----------------------

* Press Enter.
* When prompted:

  * Enter the MySQL root password you created during installation.
* If the MySQL shell opens successfully:

  * MySQL is installed correctly.

### 7. Exiting the MySQL Shell

* To exit the MySQL shell:

  * Type `quit`
  * Press Enter

### 8. Next Step

* With MySQL installed and verified:

  * The next step is to set up **Prisma**
  * Prisma will be used to interact with the database from the application

---

*** 2.2- Setting Up Prisma ***
---

## Lecture Overview: Connecting MySQL to the Application Using Prisma

### 1. Goal of This Lesson

* Now that MySQL is running, the next step is to connect the application to the database.
* This connection will be handled using **Prisma**.

---

## 2. What Is Prisma?

* Prisma is an **ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool**.
* It sits between:

  * The application code
  * The database
* Prisma acts like a translator:

  * Converts application code into database queries
  * Provides a clean and type-safe way to interact with the database

---

## 3. Preparing the Project

* Open a terminal window.
* Navigate to the **server directory** of the project.
* Two Prisma-related packages need to be installed:

  * One for development
  * One for runtime usage

---

## 4. Installing Prisma Dependencies

### 4.1 Install Prisma CLI (Development Dependency)

* Run the following command:
-------------------code----------------------
bun add -d prisma
-------------------code----------------------
* Purpose:

  * Provides a command-line interface
  * Used to create and manage the database schema

### 4.2 Install Prisma Client (Runtime Dependency)

* Run:
-------------------code----------------------
bun add @prisma/client
-------------------code----------------------
* Purpose:

  * Allows the application code to communicate with the database

---

## 5. Initializing Prisma

* Run the following command in the server directory:

-------------------code----------------------
bunx prisma init
-------------------code----------------------
* This initializes Prisma for the project.

### Result of Initialization

* A new directory named **prisma** is created.
* Inside it, a **schema file** is generated.

---

## 6. Understanding the Prisma Schema File

* The schema file contains two main sections:

  1. **Client definition**

     * Specifies how Prisma generates the client
  2. **Database definition**

     * Specifies which database is being used and how to connect to it

---

## 7. Configuring Prisma for MySQL

### 7.1 Change Database Provider

* The default provider is set to PostgreSQL.
* Change the provider to **MySQL**.

### 7.2 Database Connection URL

* Prisma uses an environment variable named:

  * `DATABASE_URL`
* Copy this key name.

---

## 8. Updating the Environment File

* Open the `.env` file.
* Prisma may add incorrect or duplicated lines due to a known issue.
* Delete the incorrect lines.
* Paste and define the correct `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## 9. MySQL Connection String Format

-------------------code----------------------
DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@host:port/database_name"
-------------------code----------------------

### Example Used in This Project

* Username: `root`
* Password: the password set during MySQL installation
* Host: `localhost`
* Port: `3306` (default MySQL port)
* Database name: `review_summarizer`

### Final Example

-------------------code----------------------
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:your_password@localhost:3306/review_summarizer"
-------------------code----------------------

### What This Does

* Connects Prisma to:

  * The local MySQL server
  * Using the root user
  * Targeting the specified database

---

## 10. Lesson Summary

* Prisma is successfully installed and initialized.
* The application is now connected to MySQL.
* The database connection is configured using environment variables.

---

## 11. Next Lesson

* Define the **structure of the database**:

  * Tables
  * Relationships
  * Fields
* This will be done using the Prisma schema.
