## Lecture Overview: Product Review Summarizer Project

### 1. Project Introduction

* This section introduces a more advanced and engaging project.
* The goal is to build a **product review summarizer**.
* Users can generate a concise summary instead of reading all individual reviews.

### 2. User Experience Flow

* A product page displays:

  * A list of user reviews for a product.
  * A button to summarize the reviews.
* When the user clicks the **Summarize Reviews** button:

  * A summary is generated automatically.
  * The summary helps users quickly understand overall feedback.

### 3. Summary Persistence

* Once the summary is generated:

  * It is stored in the database.
  * When the user revisits the page, the summary is retrieved from the database.
  * The summary does **not** need to be regenerated each time.
* This improves:

  * Performance
  * Cost efficiency
  * User experience

### 4. Common Industry Pattern

* This “generate once, reuse later” pattern is increasingly common in modern applications.
* Especially relevant for:

  * AI-powered features
  * Content summarization
  * Recommendation systems

### 5. Project Complexity

* This project is more complex than the previous chatbot project.
* It is a **full-stack application**, involving:

  * Frontend (user interface)
  * Backend (business logic)
  * Database (data storage)

### 6. Database Introduction

* The project uses a database to store summaries.
* Prior database knowledge is **not required**.
* The instructor will cover:

  * Essential database concepts
  * Only what is necessary for this project

### 7. Learning Mindset

* The project is meant to be built step by step.
* Learners are encouraged to:

  * Take their time
  * Follow along carefully
  * Treat this as a hands-on learning experience

*** 2- Setting Up the Database ***
---

## Lecture Overview: Database Setup for the Project

### 1. Project Complexity

* This project is more complex than the previously built chatbot project.
* It is a **full-stack application**.
* The application includes its **own database**, which is a core component of the system.

### 2. Purpose of This Segment

* The focus of this segment is on **setting up the database from scratch**.
* The database will serve as the foundation for the rest of the application.

### 3. Database Initialization

* The database will be:

  * Created from the ground up
  * Properly structured to support application features

### 4. Populating the Database

* The database will be filled with **realistic sample data**.
* This ensures:

  * Meaningful testing
  * More realistic development scenarios
  * Better understanding of how the application behaves with real data

### 5. Role of the Database in Development

* Having realistic data allows developers to:

  * Build features more effectively
  * Test logic and edge cases
  * Develop and debug the application with confidence

### 6. Next Steps

* With the database in place and populated:

  * The rest of the application can be built on top of it
  * Backend and frontend features can be developed incrementally

---


*** 2.1- Setting Up MySQL ***
---

## Lecture Overview: Database Setup with MySQL

### 1. Purpose of This Step

* Before building the API, a database must be set up.
* The database will store:

  * Products
  * Reviews
  * Generated summaries
* This database is a foundational part of the application.

### 2. Database Technology Choice

* The project uses **MySQL**.
* MySQL is:

  * Open source
  * A relational database system
  * Widely used in real-world production applications

### 3. Installation Options

* If MySQL is already installed locally:

  * You can continue using the existing installation.
* If MySQL is not installed:

  * Download and install it from the official website.

### 4. Downloading MySQL

* Open a browser and go to **mysql.com**.
* Navigate to the **Downloads** section.
* Scroll to the bottom and select **MySQL Community Downloads**.
* Click on **MySQL Community Server**.
* Choose the latest version for your operating system.

#### Mac-Specific Notes

* Select the correct package based on CPU architecture:

  * ARM (Apple Silicon)
  * x86 (Intel CPUs)
* On the download page:

  * No login or signup is required.
  * Click **“No thanks, just start my download”**.

### 5. Installing MySQL

* Open the installer once the download completes.
* Follow the installation steps:

  * Click **Continue**
  * Agree to the license terms
  * Proceed with installation
* When prompted:

  * Enter your computer’s login password.
* Set a password for the **root (admin) MySQL user**.

  * This password is important and will be used later in the application.
  * Make sure to remember it.
* Complete the installation.
* Enter your computer password again if requested.
* After installation, the installer file can be moved to trash.

### 6. Verifying the Installation

* Open a terminal window.
* Run the following command:
-------------------code----------------------
mysql -u root -p
-------------------code----------------------

* Press Enter.
* When prompted:

  * Enter the MySQL root password you created during installation.
* If the MySQL shell opens successfully:

  * MySQL is installed correctly.

### 7. Exiting the MySQL Shell

* To exit the MySQL shell:

  * Type `quit`
  * Press Enter

### 8. Next Step

* With MySQL installed and verified:

  * The next step is to set up **Prisma**
  * Prisma will be used to interact with the database from the application

---

*** 2.2- Setting Up Prisma ***
---

## Lecture Overview: Connecting MySQL to the Application Using Prisma

### 1. Goal of This Lesson

* Now that MySQL is running, the next step is to connect the application to the database.
* This connection will be handled using **Prisma**.

---

## 2. What Is Prisma?

* Prisma is an **ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool**.
* It sits between:

  * The application code
  * The database
* Prisma acts like a translator:

  * Converts application code into database queries
  * Provides a clean and type-safe way to interact with the database

---

## 3. Preparing the Project

* Open a terminal window.
* Navigate to the **server directory** of the project.
* Two Prisma-related packages need to be installed:

  * One for development
  * One for runtime usage

---

## 4. Installing Prisma Dependencies

### 4.1 Install Prisma CLI (Development Dependency)

* Run the following command:
-------------------code----------------------
bun add -d prisma
-------------------code----------------------
* Purpose:

  * Provides a command-line interface
  * Used to create and manage the database schema

### 4.2 Install Prisma Client (Runtime Dependency)

* Run:
-------------------code----------------------
bun add @prisma/client
-------------------code----------------------
* Purpose:

  * Allows the application code to communicate with the database

---

## 5. Initializing Prisma

* Run the following command in the server directory:

-------------------code----------------------
bunx prisma init
-------------------code----------------------
* This initializes Prisma for the project.

### Result of Initialization

* A new directory named **prisma** is created.
* Inside it, a **schema file** is generated.

---

## 6. Understanding the Prisma Schema File

* The schema file contains two main sections:

  1. **Client definition**

     * Specifies how Prisma generates the client
  2. **Database definition**

     * Specifies which database is being used and how to connect to it

---

## 7. Configuring Prisma for MySQL

### 7.1 Change Database Provider

* The default provider is set to PostgreSQL.
* Change the provider to **MySQL**.

### 7.2 Database Connection URL

* Prisma uses an environment variable named:

  * `DATABASE_URL`
* Copy this key name.

---

## 8. Updating the Environment File

* Open the `.env` file.
* Prisma may add incorrect or duplicated lines due to a known issue.
* Delete the incorrect lines.
* Paste and define the correct `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## 9. MySQL Connection String Format

-------------------code----------------------
DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@host:port/database_name"
-------------------code----------------------

### Example Used in This Project

* Username: `root`
* Password: the password set during MySQL installation
* Host: `localhost`
* Port: `3306` (default MySQL port)
* Database name: `review_summarizer`

### Final Example

-------------------code----------------------
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:your_password@localhost:3306/review_summarizer"
-------------------code----------------------

### What This Does

* Connects Prisma to:

  * The local MySQL server
  * Using the root user
  * Targeting the specified database

---

## 10. Lesson Summary

* Prisma is successfully installed and initialized.
* The application is now connected to MySQL.
* The database connection is configured using environment variables.

---

## 11. Next Lesson

* Define the **structure of the database**:

  * Tables
  * Relationships
  * Fields
* This will be done using the Prisma schema.

---


*** 2.3- Defining the Prisma Schema ***
---

## Lecture Overview: Defining the Prisma Schema

### 1. Purpose of the Prisma Schema

* The Prisma schema defines the **structure of the database** directly in the codebase.
* It specifies:

  * Tables (models)
  * Fields (columns)
  * Data types
  * Relationships between tables

---

## 2. Installing the Prisma VS Code Extension

* Before editing the schema, install the **Prisma extension**.
* Steps:

  * Open the Extensions panel in the editor
  * Search for **Prisma**
  * Install the extension
* Benefits:

  * Syntax highlighting
  * Automatic formatting
  * Autocompletion
  * Improved developer experience

---

## 3. Opening the Schema File

* Open `schema.prisma` in the `prisma` directory.
* This file is where all database models will be defined.

---

## 4. Models to Be Defined

* Three models will be created:

  1. `Product`
  2. `Review`
  3. `Summary`
* Models use **PascalCase naming convention** (first letter uppercase).

---

## 5. Defining the Product Model

### Fields

* `id`

  * Type: `Int`
  * Attributes:

    * `@id` (primary key)
    * `@default(autoincrement())`
* `name`

  * Type: `String`
* `description`

  * Type: `String?` (optional)
* `price`

  * Type: `Float`
* `reviews`

  * Type: `Review[]` (one-to-many relationship)
* `summary`

  * Type: `Summary?` (optional one-to-one relationship)

### Notes

* The `id` field uniquely identifies each product.
* Auto-increment allows the database to assign IDs automatically.

---

## 6. Defining the Review Model

### Fields

* `id`

  * Type: `Int`
  * Attributes:

    * `@id`
    * `@default(autoincrement())`
* `author`

  * Type: `String`
* `rating`

  * Type: `Int`
* `content`

  * Type: `String`
* `createdAt`

  * Type: `DateTime`
  * Attribute:

    * `@default(now())`
* `productId`

  * Type: `Int`
* `product`

  * Type: `Product`
  * Attribute:

    * `@relation(fields: [productId], references: [id])`

### Relationship Explanation

* Each review belongs to a single product.
* The `productId` field references the `id` field in the `Product` model.
* This creates a **one-to-many relationship**:

  * One product → many reviews

---

## 7. Defining the Summary Model

### Purpose

* Stores AI-generated summaries for products.
* Each summary belongs to exactly one product.

### Fields

* `id`

  * Type: `Int`
  * Attributes:

    * `@id`
    * `@default(autoincrement())`
* `productId`

  * Type: `Int`
  * Attribute:

    * `@unique`
* `product`

  * Type: `Product`
  * Attribute:

    * `@relation(fields: [productId], references: [id])`
* `content`

  * Type: `String`
* `generatedAt`

  * Type: `DateTime`
  * Attribute:

    * `@default(now())`
* `expiresAt`

  * Type: `DateTime`

### Relationship Explanation

* This is a **one-to-one relationship**:

  * One product → one summary
* The `@unique` attribute on `productId` is required to enforce one-to-one behavior.
* The `summary` field in the `Product` model is optional because:

  * A product may not yet have reviews or a summary.

---

## 8. Common Schema Errors and Fixes

### Missing Opposite Relationship

* Prisma requires relationships to be defined on both models.
* Fix by adding:

  * `reviews` and `summary` fields to the `Product` model

### One-to-One Relation Error

* Error: one-to-one relations require unique fields.
* Fix:

  * Add `@unique` to `productId` in the `Summary` model

---

## 9. Formatting the Schema

* Save the file to auto-format.
* If formatting does not work:

  * Open the command palette
  * Select **Format Document**
  * Choose **Prisma** as the formatter

---

## 10. Lesson Summary

* Database structure is now fully defined using Prisma.
* Models, fields, and relationships are clearly specified.
* The schema is ready to be used to generate database tables.

---

## 11. Next Lesson

* Use the Prisma schema to **generate actual database tables**.
* Apply the schema to the MySQL database.

---
-------------------code----------------------
model Product {
  id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name        String
  description String?
  price       Float

  reviews     Review[]
  summary     Summary?
}

model Review {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  author    String
  rating    Int
  content   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())

  productId Int
  product   Product  @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id])
}

model Summary {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  productId   Int      @unique
  product     Product  @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id])
  content     String
  generatedAt DateTime @default(now())
  expiresAt   DateTime
}
-------------------code----------------------

*** 2.4- Running Migrations ***

---

## Creating Database Tables with Prisma Migrations

### 1. Purpose of Migrations

* After defining the **Prisma schema**, the next step is to create the actual database tables.
* This is done using **Prisma migrations**, which:

  * Create or update database tables.
  * Keep the database schema in sync with the codebase.
* Think of migrations like **Git commits**, but for database changes.

---

### 2. Creating the First Migration

#### Steps:

1. Open a terminal pointing to the **server directory**.
2. Run the Prisma CLI migration command:

-------------------code----------------------
bunx prisma migrate dev
-------------------code----------------------

3. Prisma automatically:

   * Creates the database if it does not exist.
   * Detects the schema.
   * Prompts for a migration name.

4. Since this is the first migration, name it:

-------------------code----------------------
init
-------------------code----------------------

#### Best Practice:

* Every time you modify `schema.prisma`, create a **new migration**.
* Use clear, descriptive migration names.

---

### 3. Migration Files Structure

* A new directory is created:

-------------------code----------------------
prisma/
 └── migrations/
     └── 2025xxxxxx_init/
         └── migration.sql
-------------------code----------------------

#### Contents:

* Each migration folder contains:

  * A **timestamp**
  * The **migration name**
  * A `migration.sql` file

#### migration.sql:

* Contains raw SQL instructions.
* In this case:

  * `CREATE TABLE product`
  * `CREATE TABLE review`
  * `CREATE TABLE summary`
* These SQL statements are generated directly from the Prisma models.

---

### 4. Inspecting the Database Using DataGrip

#### Why DataGrip:

* A visual database client by JetBrains.
* Allows you to:

  * Browse tables
  * View data
  * Run SQL queries

#### Notes:

* Commercial software, but:

  * Free trial is available.
* Not affiliated with JetBrains.

#### Download:

* Visit: `jetbrains.com/datagrip`

---

### 5. Connecting DataGrip to MySQL

#### Setup Steps:

1. Open DataGrip and create a new project.
2. Click **+ → Data Source → MySQL**.
3. Enter connection details:

   * Host: `localhost`
   * Port: `3306`
   * User: `root`
   * Password: your MySQL password

#### First-Time Setup:

* You may see a warning about missing MySQL drivers.
* Click the provided link to download them.
* Click **Test Connection** to verify.

---

### 6. Viewing the Database and Tables

* Select the application database (e.g., `review_summarizer`).
* You will see:

  * System databases (used internally by MySQL)
  * Your application database

#### Tables inside the database:

1. `prisma_migrations`
2. `product`
3. `review`
4. `summary`

---

### 7. The prisma_migrations Table

* Used internally by Prisma.
* Tracks:

  * Migration name
  * Timestamp
  * Checksum (for validation)

#### Important:

* **Never modify this table manually**.
* Prisma uses the checksum to detect changes.
* Editing migration files after running them will cause Prisma to fail.

---

### 8. Product Table Structure

#### Columns:

* `id`
* `name`
* `description`
* `price`

#### Column Types:

* `name` is defined as:

-------------------code----------------------
VARCHAR(191)
-------------------code----------------------

#### Explanation:

* `VARCHAR` means variable-length string.
* `191` is Prisma’s default for MySQL.
* This value differs depending on the database engine:

  * MySQL
  * PostgreSQL
  * Others

---

### 9. Naming Conventions in Databases

* Common database practices:

  * Use lowercase table names
  * Use plural names (e.g., `products` instead of `product`)
* Prisma defaults to model-based naming.
* Customization is possible and will be covered later.

---

### 10. Upcoming Improvements

* In modern applications:

  * `VARCHAR(255)` is often preferred over `VARCHAR(191)`.
* In the next lesson:

  * The schema will be customized.
  * A new migration will be created to apply these changes.

---

### Key Takeaways

* Prisma migrations bridge schema definitions and real database tables.
* Each schema change requires a new migration.
* Prisma generates raw SQL automatically.
* Database clients like DataGrip help visualize and verify changes.
* Internal Prisma tables should never be edited manually.

*** 2.5- Refining the Prisma Schema ***
---

## Refining the Prisma Schema (Best Practices)

### 1. Purpose of This Cleanup

* The goal of this lesson is to **refine and clean up the Prisma schema**.
* These changes are **not required** for the application to function.
* They reflect **real-world database best practices** and improve:

  * Readability
  * Maintainability
  * Long-term scalability

---

### 2. Renaming Database Tables

#### Problem:

* Prisma uses **PascalCase** model names by default.
* Many developers prefer:

  * Lowercase table names
  * Pluralized names

#### Solution: `@@map`

* Prisma allows overriding table names using the `@@map` attribute.

#### Example:

-------------------code----------------------
model Product {
  ...
  @@map("products")
}
-------------------code----------------------

#### Applied Changes:

* `Product` → `products`
* `Review` → `reviews`
* `Summary` → `summaries`

---

### 3. Improving String Data Types

#### Default Behavior:

* Prisma maps `String` to:

-------------------code----------------------
VARCHAR(191)
-------------------code----------------------

* This is a MySQL-specific default.

#### Best Practice:

* Use more standardized lengths for strings.
* Customize column types using the `@db` attribute.

---

### 4. Updated Data Types by Model

#### Product Model

* `name`

  * Changed to `VARCHAR(255)`
* `description`

  * Changed to `TEXT` or alternatively `VARCHAR(1000)`
  * `TEXT` chosen for greater flexibility

-------------------code----------------------
name        String @db.VarChar(255)
description String @db.Text
-------------------code----------------------

---

#### Review Model

* `author`

  * Changed to `VARCHAR(255)`
* `rating`

  * Changed from `Int` to `TINYINT`
  * Reason:

    * Ratings only range from 1 to 5
    * `Int` is unnecessarily large (up to 2 billion)

-------------------code----------------------
author String @db.VarChar(255)
rating Int    @db.TinyInt
content String @db.Text
-------------------code----------------------

---

#### Summary Model

* `content`

  * Changed to `TEXT`

-------------------code----------------------
content String @db.Text
-------------------code----------------------

---

### 5. Applying the Changes

#### Steps:

1. Save the updated `schema.prisma`
2. Prisma automatically reformats the file
3. Create a new migration:

-------------------code----------------------
npx prisma migrate dev
-------------------code----------------------

4. When prompted, name the migration:

-------------------code----------------------
refine-schema
-------------------code----------------------

---

### 6. Migration Results

#### Migration Folder:

* A new directory appears under:

-------------------code----------------------
prisma/migrations/
-------------------code----------------------

* It contains:

  * Timestamp
  * Migration name (`refine-schema`)
  * SQL file with table update instructions

---

### 7. Verifying Changes in the Database

#### In DataGrip:

* Refresh the database view
* Confirm:

  * Table names are now lowercase and plural
  * Column types are updated:

    * `name` → `VARCHAR(255)`
    * `description` → `TEXT`

#### prisma_migrations Table:

* Shows the second migration as applied
* Confirms schema changes were successfully executed

---

### 8. Key Takeaways

* Prisma allows full control over:

  * Table names
  * Column types
* Using `@@map` and `@db` improves database design quality
* Small refinements early prevent technical debt later
* Every schema change must be followed by a migration

---

### 9. Next Lesson Preview

* The next lesson will focus on **populating the database with sample data**.

---


*** 2.6- Populating the Database with Realistic Data ***
---

## Populating the Database with Sample Data

### 1. Goal of This Lesson

* Populate the database with **realistic sample data**.
* This data will be used while developing and testing the application.
* Instead of writing SQL manually, we use **AI assistance** to work faster and smarter.

---

### 2. Why Use AI for Sample Data

* Writing large SQL insert scripts manually is time-consuming.
* AI can:

  * Generate realistic data
  * Follow schema constraints
  * Speed up development
* This demonstrates how AI helps developers beyond just writing application code.

---

### 3. Providing Context to ChatGPT

#### Step 1: Share the Prisma Schema

* Copy the entire `schema.prisma` file.
* Paste it into the prompt.
* This gives AI full context about:

  * Tables
  * Columns
  * Relationships
  * Data types

---

### 4. Writing an Effective Prompt

#### Core Instruction:

* Ask for a **complete SQL script** to populate tables.

Example instruction:

* Generate a complete SQL script to populate the `products` and `reviews` tables in a MySQL database based on the schema above.

---

### 5. Important Prompt Details

#### Specify the Database Engine

* Explicitly mention **MySQL**.
* If not specified, AI may default to PostgreSQL.
* PostgreSQL SQL syntax may not work in MySQL.

#### Limit the Scope

* Only populate:

  * `products`
  * `reviews`
* Do not include:

  * `summaries` table
* Reason:

  * Summaries are generated dynamically by AI at runtime.

---

### 6. Refining the Prompt with Constraints

Additional instructions improve quality and relevance.

Example refinements:

* Create 5 products.
* For each product, insert 5 realistic customer reviews.
* Ensure each review is:

  * Long
  * Relevant to the product type
* Do not include data for the `summaries` table.
* Output only the SQL script.
* Do not include comments or explanations.

#### Key Principle:

* The more specific and descriptive the prompt, the better the output.

---

### 7. Generated Sample Data

#### Result:

* 5 products created:

  * Chair
  * Smartwatch
  * Coffee maker
  * Earphones
  * Scooter
* 25 reviews total:

  * 5 reviews per product
* Reviews are realistic and tailored to each product.

---

### 8. Executing the SQL Script in DataGrip

#### Steps:

1. Open DataGrip.
2. Right-click the application database.
3. Select **New Query Console**.
4. Paste the generated SQL script.
5. Select all:

   * macOS: `Command + A`
   * Windows: `Ctrl + A`
6. Execute the script.

---

### 9. Verifying the Data

#### Results:

* `products` table contains 5 realistic entries.
* `reviews` table contains 25 reviews.
* Data is consistent and ready for development use.

---

### 10. Key Takeaways

* AI is an effective tool for generating realistic test data.
* Well-written prompts lead to higher-quality output.
* Always specify:

  * Database engine
  * Target tables
  * Output format
* Sample data enables faster backend development and testing.

---

### 11. Next Steps

* With realistic data in place, the project is now ready to move on to **building the backend**.

---

('Sarah Johnson', 5, 'Absolutely love my new iPhone 15 Pro! The titanium build feels premium and surprisingly lightweight. The camera system is phenomenal - the 48MP main sensor captures incredible detail, and the low-light performance is the best I''ve seen on any smartphone. The A17 Pro chip makes everything buttery smooth, from gaming to video editing. Face ID is faster than ever, and the battery life easily gets me through a full day of heavy use. The Dynamic Island is actually useful for tracking deliveries and music playback. Worth every penny!', '2024-01-15 10:30:00', 1),
('Michael Chen', 4, 'Great phone overall with some minor quirks. The performance is exceptional and the camera upgrades are noticeable, especially the 5x optical zoom. However, the phone does get warm during extended gaming sessions, and the USB-C transition means I had to replace all my cables. The Action Button is customizable but I wish it had more functionality options. Battery life is solid but not groundbreaking compared to previous models. Still, one of the best phones on the market right now.', '2024-01-18 14:22:00', 1),
('Jessica Williams', 5, 'Coming from iPhone 12, this feels like a massive upgrade. The 120Hz ProMotion display is incredibly smooth, making everything feel more responsive. The photos it takes are professional-level - I''ve stopped carrying my DSLR for casual outings. The build quality is outstanding, and the new matte finish doesn''t show fingerprints. The satellite connectivity for emergencies gives me peace of mind when hiking. The only downside is the price, but if you keep your phones for 3-4 years, it''s justified.', '2024-01-20 09:15:00', 1),
('Robert Miller', 3, 'Good phone but overheating issues are concerning. During my first week, the phone got uncomfortably hot during video calls and while charging. The camera produces excellent photos but the processing is sometimes too aggressive, making skin tones look unnatural. The titanium frame is nice but I actually preferred the stainless steel of previous Pro models. Performance is top-notch and iOS 17 runs flawlessly. It''s a good phone but not the revolutionary upgrade I was expecting.', '2024-01-22 16:45:00', 1),
('Amanda Davis', 4, 'The iPhone 15 Pro is a solid evolution of the iPhone formula. The USB-C port is finally here and it''s so convenient to use one cable for all my devices. The camera improvements are substantial, particularly the portrait mode with focus control after taking photos. The battery life has been reliable for my moderate usage pattern. My only complaints are the lack of significant design changes and that the base storage should be 256GB at this price point. Overall, very satisfied with my purchase.', '2024-01-25 11:30:00', 1),
('Alex Thompson', 5, 'This monitor is an absolute game-changer for both work and gaming. The 49-inch super ultrawide display gives me incredible immersion in racing sims and flight simulators. The 240Hz refresh rate with 1ms response time eliminates all motion blur - everything looks crystal clear even in fast-paced shooters. The curve is perfect and reduces eye strain during long sessions. Productivity is through the roof - I can have three full windows side by side. Picture-by-picture mode lets me connect two computers simultaneously. Best tech purchase I''ve made in years!', '2024-01-16 13:20:00', 2),
('David Wilson', 4, 'Impressive display with minor quality control issues. The size and curvature create an incredibly immersive experience, and HDR content looks stunning with deep blacks and vibrant colors. However, I experienced some backlight bleed in the bottom corners, which is noticeable in dark scenes. The stand takes up a lot of desk space but is very sturdy. Setup was straightforward and the on-screen display is intuitive. Gaming performance is exceptional - no tearing or stuttering with G-Sync enabled. Worth it if you get a good panel.', '2024-01-19 15:40:00', 2),
('Jennifer Lee', 5, 'As a video editor and graphic designer, this monitor has transformed my workflow. The color accuracy is outstanding right out of the box, covering 95% of DCI-P3 color space. Having my entire timeline, effects panel, and preview window all visible simultaneously saves me hours each week. The 5120x1440 resolution provides sharp text and detailed images. Gaming is incredible - the field of view in racing games makes me feel like I''m actually in the car. The only drawback is that it requires a powerful GPU to drive at full resolution and refresh rate.', '2024-01-21 10:10:00', 2),
('Thomas Brown', 3, 'Good monitor but has some limitations. The picture quality is excellent and the curve reduces eye strain, but I''ve encountered occasional flickering issues with certain applications. The monitor runs quite hot after several hours of use. The lack of built-in KVM switch is disappointing at this price point. The stand doesn''t have height adjustment, which might be an issue for some setups. Gaming performance is phenomenal when it works properly, but I''ve had to exchange my first unit due to dead pixels. Buyer beware of quality control.', '2024-01-23 18:30:00', 2),
('Emily Carter', 4, 'This monitor delivers an incredible immersive experience for both work and entertainment. The sheer size lets me multitask efficiently with multiple windows visible. Gaming is breathtaking - the curve wraps around your field of vision perfectly. HDR performance is good, though not as bright as some dedicated HDR monitors. The build quality feels premium and the thin bezels look modern. It does require a deep desk and a powerful graphics card. Once calibrated, colors are accurate and consistent across the entire panel. A worthwhile investment for serious users.', '2024-01-26 12:15:00', 2),
('Brian Taylor', 5, 'The Dyson V15 Detect is the best vacuum I''ve ever owned. The laser dust detection feature is revolutionary - it shows exactly where the microscopic dust is that you can''t see with naked eye. The suction power is incredible, picking up everything from pet hair to fine dust. The automatic suction adjustment between different floor types works perfectly. The HEPA filtration means no dust escapes back into the air, which is great for my allergies. Battery life lasts about 60 minutes on medium power, which is enough for my entire house. Worth every cent!', '2024-01-17 08:45:00', 3),
('Karen Martinez', 4, 'Excellent vacuum with a few design quirks. The laser feature is genuinely useful for ensuring you''ve cleaned thoroughly. The various attachments make it versatile for cleaning cars, furniture, and hard-to-reach places. However, the trigger-style power button can be tiring during longer cleaning sessions - I wish it had a toggle lock. The dust bin is easy to empty but sometimes fine dust gets stuck in crevices. The wand telescopes nicely for high ceilings. It''s significantly lighter than my old corded vacuum. Overall, very satisfied despite the premium price.', '2024-01-20 14:20:00', 3),
('Richard Clark', 5, 'As a pet owner with two dogs that shed constantly, this vacuum has been life-changing. The motorbar head doesn''t get tangled with hair like previous vacuums I''ve owned. The laser actually shows all the pet hair and dander I was missing before. The display showing exactly what you''re picking up in real-time is both satisfying and informative. Battery lasts long enough to do my entire 2000 sq ft home on a single charge. The wall mount is sturdy and keeps everything organized. It''s expensive but has saved me on professional cleaning services.', '2024-01-22 11:30:00', 3),
('Lisa Anderson', 3, 'Good vacuum but overhyped in my opinion. The laser feature is cool but after the first few uses, it becomes less necessary. The suction power is strong but not significantly better than competitors at half the price. The battery life diminishes noticeably after 6 months of use. The accessories are high quality but expensive to replace. It does a great job on hard floors but can sometimes scatter debris on low-pile carpets. It''s well-designed and looks premium, but I''m not convinced it''s worth the substantial price premium over other cordless options.', '2024-01-24 16:50:00', 3),
('Daniel White', 4, 'The Dyson V15 makes cleaning less of a chore. The automatic adjustment between different surfaces works surprisingly well, and the laser genuinely helps identify areas that need more attention. The crevice tool is perfect for car interiors. The hygienic bin emptying system is effective and doesn''t create dust clouds. My only complaints are that the battery takes 4-5 hours to fully charge and the vacuum can be top-heavy when using some attachments. For apartments and smaller homes, this is nearly perfect. For larger homes, you might need the extra battery.', '2024-01-27 09:40:00', 3),
('Christopher Lee', 5, 'The Switch OLED is the definitive version of the Nintendo Switch. The 7-inch OLED screen is absolutely stunning - colors pop, blacks are deep, and the improved brightness makes handheld play much more enjoyable. The enhanced speakers provide richer sound for both games and media. The new adjustable stand is sturdy and allows for comfortable tabletop gaming at various angles. The 64GB internal storage is welcome, though I still use a microSD card for my digital library. If you play primarily in handheld mode, this upgrade is absolutely worth it.', '2024-01-18 12:15:00', 4),
('Michelle Garcia', 4, 'Great upgrade for handheld players, less so for docked users. The OLED screen makes games like Metroid Dread and The Legend of Zelda look incredible with vibrant colors and perfect blacks. The improved battery life gives me about 5-6 hours of playtime with Breath of the Wild. The Ethernet port in the dock is convenient for stable online gaming. However, the internal hardware is identical to the original Switch, so don''t expect performance improvements. The white Joy-Cons look sleek but may show dirt more easily. Recommended if you play mostly handheld.', '2024-01-21 15:30:00', 4),
('Kevin Scott', 5, 'As someone who owns all three Switch models, the OLED is hands-down the best for handheld gaming. The screen is significantly larger than the original Switch while maintaining the same device size. Colors are richer and contrast is dramatically better. The improved kickstand makes tabletop mode actually usable in various environments. The speakers are noticeably clearer with better bass response. While it doesn''t offer performance upgrades, the quality-of-life improvements make it the best Switch experience available. Perfect for gaming on the go or around the house.', '2024-01-23 13:45:00', 4),
('Nicole Young', 3, 'Good console but the upgrade feels incremental. The OLED screen is beautiful but only really noticeable side-by-side with the original Switch. The lack of hardware improvements means games still run at the same frame rates and resolutions. The new dock looks nice but functionally identical. Battery life is slightly better but not dramatically so. If you already own a Switch and play mostly docked, there''s little reason to upgrade. For new buyers or those who play primarily handheld, it''s the best option. Wait for a true \"Switch Pro\" if you want performance gains.', '2024-01-25 17:20:00', 4),
('Steven Hall', 4, 'The Switch OLED excels at what it''s designed for - portable and tabletop gaming. The screen is gorgeous, making indie games and first-party Nintendo titles look their absolute best. The new stand is infinitely more useful than the flimsy original. Storage upgrade is appreciated since some games like Doom Eternal are massive downloads. The console feels premium and well-built. My only complaint is that Nintendo didn''t include a screen protector in the box for such an expensive screen. Overall, if you don''t own a Switch yet, this is the version to get.', '2024-01-28 10:55:00', 4),
('Patricia King', 5, 'The Instant Pot Duo Plus has revolutionized my cooking routine. As someone who works long hours, being able to come home and have a healthy meal ready in minutes is incredible. The 9-quart size is perfect for meal prepping or cooking for my family of four. The yogurt function alone has saved me hundreds of dollars compared to store-bought yogurt. The 15 safety features give me peace of mind, especially the lid lock and pressure release indicators. The stainless steel inner pot is durable and dishwasher safe. This has replaced my slow cooker, rice cooker, and steamer!', '2024-01-19 09:30:00', 5),
('Matthew Wright', 4, 'Excellent multi-cooker with a learning curve. The number of functions is impressive - I particularly love the sous vide feature for perfect steaks. The 14 smart programs take the guesswork out of pressure cooking times. However, the controls can be confusing initially, and the manual could be more comprehensive. The keep-warm function works well but sometimes overcooks delicate foods if left too long. Cleanup is easy, though the sealing ring tends to retain odors that need occasional cleaning. Once you master it, this becomes an indispensable kitchen appliance.', '2024-01-22 18:15:00', 5),
('Sandra Lopez', 5, 'This Instant Pot has made cooking from scratch accessible despite my busy schedule. I can make beans from dry in under an hour, tenderize cheap cuts of meat, and cook perfect rice every time. The delay start function lets me prep ingredients in the morning and have dinner ready when I get home. The stainless steel construction feels durable and is BPA-free. The steam release handle is well-designed and prevents accidental burns. I''ve successfully made everything from cheesecake to hard-boiled eggs. The best kitchen investment I''ve made in years - it pays for itself quickly!', '2024-01-24 12:40:00', 5),
('Edward Hill', 3, 'Good pressure cooker but not without flaws. The cooking functions work well and produce delicious meals quickly. However, I''ve experienced inconsistent results with the rice function - sometimes perfect, sometimes mushy. The size is large, which is great for big batches but takes up considerable counter space. The inner pot has hot spots that can cause burning if not enough liquid is used. The display isn''t backlit, making it hard to read in low light. It''s a solid multicooker but I think some of the hype is overblown. Still useful for busy households.', '2024-01-26 14:25:00', 5),
('Rebecca Green', 4, 'The Instant Pot Duo Plus lives up to most of its promises. I use it several times a week for everything from quick weeknight dinners to Sunday meal prep. The pressure cooking function tenderizes meats beautifully and infuses flavors deeply. The sauté function means I can brown meat and then pressure cook all in one pot. The sterilize function has been great for baby bottles. My only complaints are that it takes time to come to pressure and release pressure, and the buttons beep loudly. Overall, it''s a versatile tool that has earned its place in my kitchen.', '2024-01-29 11:10:00', 5);

The keep-warm function works well but sometimes overcooks delicate foods if left too long. Cleanup is easy, though the sealing ring tends to retain odors that need occasional cleaning. Once you master it, this becomes an indispensable kitchen appliance.', '2024-01-22 18:15:00', 5),
('Sandra Lopez', 5, 'This Instant Pot has made cooking from scratch accessible despite my busy schedule. I can make beans from dry in under an hour, tenderize cheap cuts of meat, and cook perfect rice every time. The delay start function lets me prep ingredients in the morning and have dinner ready when I get home. The stainless steel construction feels durable and is BPA-free. The steam release handle is well-designed and prevents accidental burns. I''ve successfully made everything from cheesecake to hard-boiled eggs. The best kitchen investment I''ve made in years - it pays for itself quickly!', '2024-01-24 12:40:00', 5),
('Edward Hill', 3, 'Good pressure cooker but not without flaws. The cooking functions work well and produce delicious meals quickly. However, I''ve experienced inconsistent results with the rice function - sometimes perfect, sometimes mushy. The size is large, which is great for big batches but takes up considerable counter space. The inner pot has hot spots that can cause burning if not enough liquid is used. The display isn''t backlit, making it hard to read in low light. It''s a solid multicooker but I think some of the hype is overblown. Still useful for busy households.', '2024-01-26 14:25:00', 5),
('Rebecca Green', 4, 'The Instant Pot Duo Plus lives up to most of its promises. I use it several times a week for everything from quick weeknight dinners to Sunday meal prep. The pressure cooking function tenderizes meats beautifully and infuses flavors deeply. The sauté function means I can brown meat and then pressure cook all in one pot. The sterilize function has been great for baby bottles. My only complaints are that it takes time to come to pressure and release pressure, and the buttons beep loudly. Overall, it''s a versatile tool that has earned its place in my kitchen.', '2024-01-29 11:10:00', 5);" > seed_data.sql
-------------------code----------------------

2. Run the SQL file with MySQL:
-------------------code----------------------
mysql -u root -p review_summarizer < seed_data.sql
-------------------code----------------------

## Method 2: Using Prisma Client in your application

Create a seed script (`prisma/seed.ts` or `prisma/seed.js`):

-------------------code----------------------
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  // Clear existing data (optional)
  await prisma.review.deleteMany()
  await prisma.summary.deleteMany()
  await prisma.product.deleteMany()

  // Create products
  const products = await prisma.product.createMany({
    data: [
      {
        name: 'iPhone 15 Pro',
        description: 'The latest flagship smartphone from Apple featuring A17 Pro chip, titanium design, 48MP main camera, and Dynamic Island.',
        price: 999.99
      },
      {
        name: 'Samsung Odyssey G9 Gaming Monitor',
        description: '49-inch dual QHD curved gaming monitor with 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and NVIDIA G-Sync compatibility.',
        price: 1299.99
      },
      {
        name: 'Dyson V15 Detect Cordless Vacuum',
        description: 'High-power cordless vacuum with laser dust detection, HEPA filtration, and intelligent suction adjustment.',
        price: 749.99
      },
      {
        name: 'Nintendo Switch OLED',
        description: 'Gaming console with 7-inch OLED screen, enhanced audio, 64GB internal storage, and adjustable stand.',
        price: 349.99
      },
      {
        name: 'Instant Pot Duo Plus 9-in-1',
        description: '9-quart multi-use programmable pressure cooker with 15 safety features and 14 one-touch smart programs.',
        price: 129.99
      }
    ]
  })

  // Create reviews for each product
  const reviewsData = [
    // Product 1 reviews...
    // (Copy all the review data from the SQL script)
  ]

  await prisma.review.createMany({
    data: reviewsData
  })
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    console.error(e)
    process.exit(1)
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
-------------------code----------------------

Then run it:
-------------------code----------------------
npx ts-node prisma/seed.ts
# or if using bun
bun prisma/seed.ts
-------------------code----------------------

## Method 3: Quick MySQL command line

Copy the entire SQL script and paste it directly into MySQL:

-------------------code----------------------
mysql -u root -p review_summarizer
-------------------code----------------------

Then paste the entire INSERT statements and press Enter.

## Method 4: Using a GUI tool (easiest)

1. Install **TablePlus**, **MySQL Workbench**, or **Sequel Ace**
2. Connect to your MySQL database
3. Open a new query window
4. Paste the entire SQL script
5. Click "Execute" or "Run"

**Recommendation:** Use **Method 1** (SQL file import) - it's the simplest and most reliable. Just save the SQL script and run one command.
