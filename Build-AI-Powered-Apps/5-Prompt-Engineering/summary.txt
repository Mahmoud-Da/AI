Section Recap: Prompt Engineering
• Prompt engineering is the art of crafting instructions that guide a language model to
produce better, more reliable responses.
• A well-crafted prompt typically includes three parts: instructions, context, and the
desired output format.
• The way we word a prompt can significantly impact the quality, accuracy, and
structure of the model’s output.
• A good prompt clearly defines the model’s role, target audience, tone, and desired
outcome.
• We explored different prompting techniques, including zero-shot, one-shot, and
few-shot prompting, depending on how much guidance the model needs.
• Providing context and background information helps the model generate responses
that are grounded and relevant.
• Giving explicit instructions improves clarity and reduces ambiguity in the model’s
behavior.
• We can shape the output format by asking for plain text, markdown, comma-
separated values, or structured JSON.
• For structured output, we learned to define the expected shape using schema
examples or descriptions of valid keys and values.
• We practiced building and refining prompts using OpenAI’s Playground, applying
what we learned to guide and test model behavior.



Prompt Engineering Exercises
In this set of exercises, you’ll play around with prompts and see how small tweaks can
make your chatbot much more helpful and user-friendly. The idea is to break the chatbot
a little, notice the problem, and then fix it with a better prompt.
You’ll find the suggested answers at the end of this PDF. But try the exercises yourself
first. You’ll learn a lot more that way!

Exercise 1: Fixing Poorly Formatted Ticket Prices
1. Ask your chatbot: “How much are tickets?”
2. Pay attention to the response. Right now, it probably tries to dump a table into
the chat - not very user-friendly!
3. Your challenge: update your prompt so the chatbot summarizes ticket prices in a
simple list.
4. You might notice that when the chatbot outputs a bulleted list, the bullets don’t
actually show up in your app. That’s because Tailwind removes default list styles.
To fix this, you can use the Tailwind Typography plugin, which restores nice
defaults for lists, headings, and other rich text.

Exercise 2: Adding a Ticket Link
1. Ask: “Where can I buy tickets?” or “How much are tickets?”
2. Notice that the chatbot gives you prices, but it doesn’t actually help you buy
them.
3. Your task: refine the prompt so whenever tickets are mentioned, the chatbot
includes this link: https://wonderworld.com/tickets

Exercise 3: Adding a Ticket Link
1. Ask your chatbot: “What rides do you have?”
2. Notice how it just throws out a huge list for every age group. That’s
overwhelming!
3. Your job: tweak the prompt so the chatbot first asks a quick clarifying question to
identify the rider profile.
4. Once the user picks, the chatbot should only show the rides for that group. Much
cleaner and more helpful.
