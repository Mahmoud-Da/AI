Section Recap: Setting Up a Full-Stack Project
• We created a modern full-stack development environment using Bun as our
runtime and workspace manager.
• Our project structure followed a monorepo setup with two packages: client for
the frontend and server for the backend.
• We installed and configured Bun, and learned how it simplifies package
management, scripting, and TypeScript support compared to Node.js.
• We set up workspaces so both the client and server share dependencies and can
be run together with a single command.
• We used Vite to scaffold the React frontend.
• We configured a proxy in Vite so the frontend could communicate with the backend
during development.
• We integrated Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and added shadcn/ui for
prebuilt, accessible UI components.
• We added Prettier to automatically format our code and defined consistent
formatting rules with a .prettierrc file.
• We set up Husky and lint-staged to run formatting checks before each commit,
ensuring a clean codebase.
• We managed environment variables securely using .env files and the dotenv
package, and discussed best practices for environment-specific settings.
