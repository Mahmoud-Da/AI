# Full Stack Project Setup

### Course Foundation Overview

## 1. Introduction

Before building the application, we need to set up a clean, modern full stack project. This project will serve as the foundation for everything covered throughout the course.

## 2. Why Not Use Existing Templates

There are many templates and GitHub starter projects for full stack applications, but this course does not rely on them because:

* We want full control over the setup.
* We avoid depending on someone else’s configuration.
* We do not want to introduce tools that have not yet been explained.

## 3. Why Not Use Next.js

Although Next.js is a powerful full stack framework built on React:

* It has its own learning curve.
* Not everyone likes using it.
* The course should not require Next.js knowledge beforehand.

Instead, the entire setup will be built manually for clarity and flexibility.

## 4. Tools Used in the Setup

The project will be built from scratch using the following technologies:

### Core Tools

* **Bun**: For package management and running the development environment.
* **Vite**: For creating and bundling the frontend.
* **Express**: For building the backend API.

### Additional Tools

* **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the frontend.
* **ShadCN UI**: For reusable UI components.
* **Prettier**: For formatting the codebase.
* **Husky**: For automating workflows, such as pre-commit checks.

## 5. Outcome of This Section

By the end of this part of the course, you will have:

* A fully configured full stack foundation.
* A lightweight and scalable structure.
* A setup that is clean, transparent, and easy to understand.
* A development environment fully customized and owned by you.

## 6. Next Steps

With the tools and structure planned, the next step is to begin the actual setup and configuration of the project.
