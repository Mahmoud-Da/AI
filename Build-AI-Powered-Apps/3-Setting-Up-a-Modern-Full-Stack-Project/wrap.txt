# Full Stack Project Setup

### Course Foundation Overview

## 1. Introduction

Before building the application, we need to set up a clean, modern full stack project. This project will serve as the foundation for everything covered throughout the course.

## 2. Why Not Use Existing Templates

There are many templates and GitHub starter projects for full stack applications, but this course does not rely on them because:

* We want full control over the setup.
* We avoid depending on someone else’s configuration.
* We do not want to introduce tools that have not yet been explained.

## 3. Why Not Use Next.js

Although Next.js is a powerful full stack framework built on React:

* It has its own learning curve.
* Not everyone likes using it.
* The course should not require Next.js knowledge beforehand.

Instead, the entire setup will be built manually for clarity and flexibility.

## 4. Tools Used in the Setup

The project will be built from scratch using the following technologies:

### Core Tools

* **Bun**: For package management and running the development environment.
* **Vite**: For creating and bundling the frontend.
* **Express**: For building the backend API.

### Additional Tools

* **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the frontend.
* **ShadCN UI**: For reusable UI components.
* **Prettier**: For formatting the codebase.
* **Husky**: For automating workflows, such as pre-commit checks.

## 5. Outcome of This Section

By the end of this part of the course, you will have:

* A fully configured full stack foundation.
* A lightweight and scalable structure.
* A setup that is clean, transparent, and easy to understand.
* A development environment fully customized and owned by you.

## 6. Next Steps

With the tools and structure planned, the next step is to begin the actual setup and configuration of the project.

# Introduction to Bun

### A Modern JavaScript Runtime for This Course

## 1. What Is Bun

* Bun is a modern JavaScript runtime similar to Node.js.
* It is designed to be faster and more integrated than the traditional Node.js toolchain.

## 2. Why Use Bun

With Node.js, developers typically rely on several separate tools:

* **npm** for package installation
* **ts-node** for running TypeScript
* **nodemon** for automatically restarting the server

Bun replaces all of these by providing:

* A JavaScript and TypeScript runtime
* A package manager
* A task runner
* A built-in TypeScript transpiler

This means Bun can run TypeScript files directly without requiring additional tools.

## 3. Compatibility with Node.js

* If someone prefers using Node.js, everything taught in the course can still be done with Node.
* However, Bun generally offers a cleaner and more enjoyable development experience.

## 4. Installing Bun

### Steps

1. Go to **bun.sh**.
2. On the homepage, locate the installation command for your operating system.
3. Copy the command and run it in your terminal.
-------------------code----------------------
curl -fsSL https://bun.com/install | bash
-------------------code----------------------
4. Follow the terminal instructions.

   * On macOS, for example, you may need to run:

     -------------------code----------------------
     exec /bin/zsh
     -------------------code----------------------

## 5. Verify Installation

After installation, run:

-------------------code----------------------
bun --version
-------------------code----------------------

Example:

* The instructor is using Bun version **1.2.17**.

## 6. Next Lesson

The next part of the course will cover the project structure.
