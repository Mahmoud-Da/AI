Build AI-Powered Apps
Section Recap: Building a Chatbot
• We built a fully functional AI-powered chatbot, step by step, using a clean and
modern full-stack architecture.
• The backend was built with Express and TypeScript, and we used the OpenAI API
to generate responses from the model.
• We started by implementing a basic /api/chat endpoint that received prompts
and returned responses from the model.
• We gradually improved this API by adding input validation, error handling, and a
conversation ID to maintain context across turns.
• We separated concerns in our backend by extracting route handlers, a controller, a
service, and a repository into individual modules.
• On the frontend, we built a chat interface using React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui
for a polished look and feel.
• We used react-hook-form to manage form state and handle prompt
submission.
• We implemented message rendering, styled messages based on the sender, and
supported markdown formatting for richer output.
• We added a typing indicator to simulate a real-time bot experience and handled
auto-scrolling to keep new messages in view.
• We introduced subtle UX improvements like preventing empty or whitespace-only
messages and maintaining a clean layout.
• Once the chatbot was functional, we refactored our code to make it modular,
separating components like ChatInput, ChatMessages, TypingIndicator,
and Chatbot.
• We followed the principle of abstraction by exposing a clear public interface for
each component while keeping implementation details private.
• We also discussed how this approach leads to better maintainability, flexibility, and
separation of concerns — key habits of strong software engineers.
